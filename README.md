# CodeComp3-Provisioning infrastructure

## Step-by-step guide

1. Setting up Google Cloud Project (skip if you already have a GCP Project)
-  Go to [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) and click on **Get Started for FREE**.
-  Login using your gmail account, choose your country, accept terms and conditions and click **Continue**.
-  In the next step, fill your details, like account type, Name, Address, credit card details, tax information, etc. If you have old Gmail account and all the information is already there it would take it and you might not have to fill all the details.
-  After filling all the details click on **Start my free trial**.
-  Google will setup your cloud account and in few seconds your Google Cloud Platform account will be ready to start deploying applications on it. It will look like below:

  - Click on **Create Service Account**
  - Under **Service Account Details** provide service account **name** and **description** of your choice and click on **Create**

  - Again click on New Secret and add Name as **GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS** and value as *contents of json file that you downloaded and click on Add Secret
  
  - KEEP IN MIND, not to change Secret Names otherwise you will need to alter .github/workflows/terraform.yml file

4. Editing github actions workflow to create required infrastructure
  - In your forked repository, Visit .github/workflows/terraform.yml
  - Edit this file online by clicking on pencil icon on top right.
  - Replace your actual codecomp3 team name with <team-name> on line 27 and line 46 as shown in figure below with yellow highligher

  - Click on Start Commit and then Commit Changes
  - On commiting changes, you can see the Git Action running in Actions tab. Wait for this to complete as shown below:

5. When this Action gets completed you have the infrastructure ready to deploy your codecomp3 bot on.
